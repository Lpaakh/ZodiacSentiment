# ZodiacSentiment

In this project, we train a deep neural network on labeled twitter data to analyze the sentiments of tweets, 
and then test the neural network to determine what zodiac signs are being talked about the most positively.

We visualized this data on Tableau:

And are working on a consumer-friendly visualization
